# algo-trader
My Event Driven Algo Trading Backtester in Kotlin. Based loosely on ideas from [this tutorial](https://www.quantstart.com/articles/Event-Driven-Backtesting-with-Python-Part-I/)
Using [Tablesaw](https://github.com/jtablesaw/tablesaw) for data wrangling.

This is by no means a finished product. I was also learning Kotlin in the process
So use at your own risk. Create issues if you encounter any bugs and I'll look into them when I have time.
